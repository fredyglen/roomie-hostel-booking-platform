Add custom data to your request payload
Crafting Metadata

With metadata, you can add additional parameters that an endpoint doesn't accept naturally. Crafting metadata will depend on your language's handling of JSON. Common metadata are:

    Invoice ID
    Cart ID
    Cart Items
    Payment medium (site/app)

There are two ways to add parameters to the metadata object:

    Key/value pair: You pass the parameter as a key and value pair like this: cart_id: IU929. Parameters passed this way don't show up on the dashboard, however, they are returned with the API response.
    Custom Fields: The custom_fields key is reserved for an array of custom fields that should show on the dashboard when you click the transaction.

Custom fields have 3 keys: display_name, variable_name, and value. The display name will be the label for the value when displaying.

    JSON

{

  "metadata": {

    "cart_id": 398,

    "custom_fields": [

      {

        "display_name": "Invoice ID",

        "variable_name": "Invoice ID",

        "value": 209

      },

      {

        "display_name": "Cart Items",

        "variable_name": "cart_items",

        "value": "3 bananas, 12 mangoes"

      }

    ]

  }

}

Cancel Action

You can redirect your users to a chosen URL when they cancel a payment. This is done by setting a cancel_action in your metadata:

"metadata": {

  "cancel_action": "https://your-cancel-url.com"

}

Custom Filters

Custom filters allow you control how a transaction is completed by using the custom_filters object in the metadata object.
Recurring Payment

If you need to debit your customer in future, specify recurring=true in the custom_filters object.

"metadata": {

  "custom_filters": {

    "recurring": true

  }

}

This is supported for the Card and Pay with Bank (PwB) channels with a different behaviour for each channel.
Card

With the card channel, we accept only Verve cards that support recurring billing and force a bank authentication for MasterCard and VISA.
Pay with Bank

With the pwb channel, we'll only make the supported banks available for customers to make payment. Banks that don't support recurring payments are filtered out.
Selected Bank Cards

You can use the banks parameter to specify a the bank codes when you only want particular bank cards to be accepted for a transaction. You can use the List BanksAPI to get the list of supported bank codes.

"metadata": {

  "custom_filters": {

    "banks": ["057", "100"]

  }

}

Selected Card Brands

If you only want certain card brand(s) to be accepted for a transaction, specify the brands in the card_brands array:

"metadata": {

  "custom_filters": {

    "card_brands": ["visa"]

  }

}

We currently support the following card brands:
Brand	Code	Country
Verve	verve	Nigeria
Visa	visa	All regions
Mastercard	mastercard	All regions

The filters can also be combined for a comprehensive rule. In the snippet below, the filters tell us that the customer should be enrolled on recurring billing and we should only accept a visa card from Zenith (057) or Suntrust bank (100).

    JSON

{

  "metadata": {

    "custom_filters": {

      "recurring": true,

      "banks": [

        "057",

        "100"

      ],

      "card_brands": [

        "visa"

      ]

    }

  }

}

Selected Bank Accounts

The supported_bank_providers parameter allows you to specify the banks you want on the Pay with Bank channel. When set, the customer will only see the banks you specified. You should use the List BanksAPI endpoint to get the bank codes.

"metadata": {

  "custom_filters": {

    "supported_bank_providers": [

      "033",

      "215",

      "102"

    ]

  }

}

Selected MoMo Provider

Sometimes, you want to give preference to only certain mobile money providers. For example, you might want to run a campaign to allow just a certain provider. To do this, you can specify the provider(s) in the supported_mobile_money_providers parameter:

"metadata": {

  "custom_filters": {

    "supported_mobile_money_providers": ["vod"]

  }

}

Provider	Code	Country
MTN	mtn	Ghana
AirtelTigo	atl	Ghana
Vodafone	vod	Ghana

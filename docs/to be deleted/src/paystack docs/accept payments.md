Accept Payments
In a nutshell

To accept a payment, create a transaction using our API, our client Javascript library, Popup JS, or our SDKs. Every transaction includes a link that can be used to complete payment.
Popup

Paystack Popup is a Javascript library that allow developers to build a secure and convenient payment flow for their web applications. You can add it to your frontend application via CDN, NPM or Yarn:

    CDNNPMYarn

<script src="https://js.paystack.co/v2/inline.js">

If you used NPM or Yarn, ensure you import the library as shown below:

import PaystackPop from '@paystack/inline-js'

With the library successfully installed, you can now begin the three-step integration process:

    Initialize transaction
    Complete transaction
    Verify transaction status

Initialize transaction

To get started, you need to initialize the transaction from your backend. Initializing the transaction from the backend ensures you have full control of the transaction details. To do this, make a POST request from your backend to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint:
Show Response

curl https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize

-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"

-H "Content-Type: application/json"

-d '{ "email": "customer@email.com", 

      "amount": "500000"

    }'

-X POST

The data object of the response contains an access_code parameter that is needed to complete the transaction. You should store this parameter and send it to your frontend.
Do not use your secret key in your frontend

Never call the Paystack API directly from your frontend to avoid exposing your secret key on the frontend. All requests to the Paystack API should be initiated from your server, and your frontend gets the response from your server.
Complete transaction

Your frontend application should make a request to your backend to initialize the transaction and get the access_code as described in the previous section. On getting the access_code from your backend, you can then use Popup to complete the transaction:

const popup = new PaystackPop()

popup.resumeTransaction(access_code)

The resumeTransaction method triggers the checkout in the browser, allowing the user to choose their preferred payment channel to complete the transaction. You can check out the InlineJS reference guide to learn about the features available in Popup V2.
Verify transaction status

Finally, you need to confirm the status of the transaction by using either webhooks or the verify transactions endpoint. Regardless of the method used, you need to use the following parameter to confirm if you should deliver value to your customer or not:
Parameter	Description
data.status	This inidicates if the payment is successful or not
data.amount	This indicates the price of your product or service in the lower denomination of your currency.
Verify amount

When verifying the status of a transaction, you should also verify the amount to ensure it matches the value of the service you are delivering. If the amount doesn't match, do not deliver value to the customer.
Redirect

Here, you call the Initialize TransactionAPI from your server to generate a checkout link, then redirect your users to the link so they can pay. After payment is made, the users are returned to your website at the callback_url
Warning

Confirm that your server can conclude a TLSv1.2 connection to Paystack's servers. Most up-to-date software have this capability. Contact your service provider for guidance if you have any SSL errors.
Collect customer information

To initialize the transaction, you'll need to pass information such as email, first name, last name amount, transaction reference, etc. Email and amount are required. You can also pass any other additional information in the metadata object field.

The customer information can be retrieved from your database, session or cookie if you already have it stored, or from a form like in the example below.

    HTML

<form action="/save-order-and-pay" method="POST"> 

  <input type="hidden" name="user_email" value="<?php echo $email; ?>"> 

  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="<?php echo $amount; ?>"> 

  <input type="hidden" name="cartid" value="<?php echo $cartid; ?>"> 

  <button type="submit" name="pay_now" id="pay-now" title="Pay now">Pay now</button>

</form>

Initialize transaction

When a customer clicks the payment action button, initialize a transaction by making a POST request to our API. Pass the email, amount and any other parameters to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint.

If the API call is successful, we will return an authorization URL which you will redirect to for the customer to input their payment information to complete the transaction.

Important notes

    The amount should be in the subunit of the supported currency.
    We used the cart_id from the form above as our transaction reference. You should use a unique transaction identifier from your system as your reference.
    We set the callback_url in the transaction_data array. If you don't do this, we'll use the one that is set on your dashboard. Setting it in the code allows you to be flexible with the redirect URL if you need to
    If you don't set a callback URL on the dashboard or on the code, the users will not be redirected back to your site after payment.
    You can set test callback URLs for test transactions and live callback URLs for live transactions.

    PHP

<?php

  $url = "https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize";


  $fields = [

    'email' => "customer@email.com",

    'amount' => "20000",

    'callback_url' => "https://hello.pstk.xyz/callback",

    'metadata' => ["cancel_action" => "https://your-cancel-url.com"]

  ];


  $fields_string = http_build_query($fields);


  //open connection

  $ch = curl_init();

  

  //set the url, number of POST vars, POST data

  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL, $url);

  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POST, true);

  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);

  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(

    "Authorization: Bearer SECRET_KEY",

    "Cache-Control: no-cache",

  ));

  

  //So that curl_exec returns the contents of the cURL; rather than echoing it

  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); 

  

  //execute post

  $result = curl_exec($ch);

  echo $result;

?>

Verify Transaction

If the transaction is successful, Paystack will redirect the user back to a callback_url you set. We'll append the transaction reference in the URL. In the example above, the user will be redirected to http://your_website.com/postpayment_callback.php?reference=YOUR_REFERENCE.

So you retrieve the reference from the URL parameter and use that to call the verify endpoint to confirm the status of the transaction. Learn more about verifying transactions.

It's very important that you call the Verify endpoint to confirm the status of the transactions before delivering value. Just because the callback_url was visited doesn't prove that transaction was successful.
Handle Webhook

When a payment is successful, Paystack sends a charge.success webhook event to webhook URL that you provide. Learn more about using webhooks.
Mobile SDKs

With our mobile SDKs, we provide a collection of methods and interfaces tailored to the aesthetic of the platform. Transactions are initiated on the server and completed in the SDK. The SDK requires an access_code to display the UI component that accepts payment.

To get the access_code, you need to initialize a transaction by making a POST request on your server to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint:
Show Response

curl https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize

-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"

-H "Content-Type: application/json"

-d '{ "email": "customer@email.com", 

      "amount": "500000"

    }'

-X POST

On a successful initialization of the transaction, you get a response that contains an access_code. You need to return this access_code back to your mobile app.
Secret key safeguarding

Do not make an API request to the Initialize Transaction endpoint directly on your mobile app because it requires your secret key. Your secret key should only be used on your server where stronger security measures can be put in place.

With the access_code in place, you can now use the SDKs to complete the transaction.
Android SDK

You need to install the SDK by adding the paystack-ui dependency to the dependencies block of your app-level build.gradle file:
Latest dependency version

You should check Maven Central to get the latest version before installation.

    build.gradle

dependencies {

  implementation 'com.paystack.android:paystack-ui:0.0.9'

}

With all the requirements for accepting payment now in place, you can initialize and use the SDK as shown below:

    KotlinJava

// other imports


import com.paystack.android.core.Paystack

import com.paystack.android.ui.paymentsheet.PaymentSheet

import com.paystack.android.ui.paymentsheet.PaymentSheetResult


class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var paymentSheet: PaymentSheet


    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // Other code snippets


        Paystack.builder()

            .setPublicKey("pk_test_xxxx")

            .build()

        paymentSheet = PaymentSheet(this, ::paymentComplete)


    }


    private fun makePayment() {

        // Pass access_code from transaction initialize call

        paymentSheet.launch("br6cgmvflhn3qtd")

    }



    private fun paymentComplete(paymentSheetResult: PaymentSheetResult) {

        val message = when (paymentSheetResult) {

            PaymentSheetResult.Cancelled -> "Cancelled"

            is PaymentSheetResult.Failed -> {

                Log.e("Something went wrong", paymentSheetResult.error.message.orEmpty(), paymentSheetResult.error)

                paymentSheetResult.error.message ?: "Failed"

            }


            is PaymentSheetResult.Completed -> {

                // Returns the transaction reference  PaymentCompletionDetails(reference={TransactionRef})

                Log.d("Payment successful", paymentSheetResult.paymentCompletionDetails.toString())

                "Successful"

            }

        }

    }

}

You can check out the Android SDK reference to learn more about the methods and interfaces available for integration.
iOS SDK

The installation of the SDK can be done via the Swift Package Manager. To add the required packages, ensure you have the latest version of XCode installed and follow these steps:

    Select File > Add Package Dependencies…
    Copy the repo URL and paste it in the search box of the package dependency popup

You can read the Swift Package Manager documentation to learn more about adding packages to your project.

With all the requirements for accepting payment now in place, you can initialize and use the SDK:

    SwiftUIUIKit

import SwiftUI

import PaystackCore

import PaystackUI


struct PaymentView: View {

	let paystack = try? PaystackBuilder

			.newInstance

			.setKey("pk_domain_xxxxxxxx")

			.build()


	var body: some View {

		VStack(spacing: 8) {

			Text("Make Payemnt")


			paystack?.chargeUIButton(accessCode: "0peioxfhpn", onComplete: paymentDone) {

				Text("Initiate Payment")

			}

		}

		.padding()

	}


	func paymentDone(_ result: TransactionResult) {

		// Handle transaction result

		print(result)

	}

}


// ....

You can check out the iOS SDK reference to learn more about the methods and interfaces available for integration.
Charge API

The Create ChargeAPI endpoint allows you to pass details of any payment channel directly to Paystack, along with the transaction details (email, amount, etc). We provide a couple of payment channels that you can harness based on your use case.
Use cases

The Charge API exposes the core components powering our checkout. Developers can use these component to develop solutions that will cater to their customers specific needs. Some of these needs include:

    Serving non-smartphone users. Some of your users might be using mobile phones that can't access the internet. With the charge API, you can initiate a payment request form your server and send a prompt for payment completion via phone numbers to these users.
    Harnessing mobile OS APIs for a better user experience. Some businesses offer their products via mobile apps (Android and iOS). Mobile operating systems provide a rich set of APIs that developers can take advantage of. One of such APIs allow developers to autofill an OTP in a form. There are also APIs for dialing codes. Developers can combine the charge API with the mobile OS APIs to provide a richer experience to their users. 

Here is a sample payload to the Charge API containing transaction details and an object for a payment instrument - in this case Mobile money:

    JSON

{

  "amount": 1000,

  "email": "customer@email.com",

  "currency": "GHS",

  "mobile_money": {

    "phone": "0553241149",

    "provider": "MTN"

  }

}

Handling Charge API responses

When you call the Create ChargeAPI endpoint, the response contains a data.status which tells you what the next step in the process. Depending on the value in the data.status, you may need to prompt the user for an input as indicated in the response message (like OTP or pin or date of birth), or display an action that the user needs to complete on their device - like scanning a QR code or dialling a USSD code or redirecting to a 3DSecure page. So you follow the prompt on the data.status until there is no more user input required, then you listen for events via webhooks.

For the steps that prompt for user input, you will be required to display a form to the user to collect the requested input and send it to the relevant endpoint as shown in the table below. For the steps that require the user to complete an action on their device, we recommend that you display a button for the user to confirm the payment after they have performed that action so that you can listen for events via webhooks.

Below is the list of responses you can receive from the Create ChargeAPI endpoint and what you should do next:
Value	Description
pending	Transaction is being processed. Call Check pending charge at least 10seconds after getting this status to check status
timeout	Transaction has failed. You may start a new charge after showing data.message to user
success	Transaction is successful. You can now provide value
send_birthday	Customer's birthday is needed to complete the transaction. Show data.display_text to user with an input that accepts the birthdate and submit to the Submit BirthdayAPI endpoint with reference and birthday
send_otp	Paystack needs OTP from customer to complete the transaction. Show data.display_text to user with an input that accepts OTP and submit the OTP to the Submit OTPAPI endpoint with reference and otp
failed	Transaction failed. No remedy for this, start a new charge after showing data.message to user
Handle Webhook

When a payment is successful, Paystack sends a charge.success webhook event to webhook URL that you provide. It is highly recommended that you use webhooks to confirm the payment status before delivering value to your customers.
